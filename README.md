# platypus

platypus is a language designed to combine a safety-first ownership model and a developer friendly syntax. The intention is to enforce memory-safe practices at compilation, significantly reducing the runtimeâ€™s memory management overhead. Rust, the largest competitor in this domain, is a low-level systems language that can be difficult to understand for a user who is used to higher-level languages such as Python and JavaScript. Our goal is to act as an intermediary between these two parties.
